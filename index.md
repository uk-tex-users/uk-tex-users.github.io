# Accessibility

Two of us (Jonathan and Shaun) have a special interest in accessible math content.

# UK TeX Hour

Since January 2021 one of us (Jonathan) has been running a weekly zoom TeX Hour (for an international audience).
If there's interest we could have a regular UK TeX Hour, and occassional speaker and discussion meetings.

The (international) TeX Hour usually meets every Thursday evening, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Contact jfine2358@gmail.com for the zoom URL. Here's the TeX Hour [recorded videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmCKEgzdM6fTYtfivRdzajw/playlists).
